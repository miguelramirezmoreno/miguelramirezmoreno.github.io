Welcome to my website!
======
My name is Miguel Ramírez Moreno, PhD and, in 2023, postdoctoral researcher at the University of Southampton (United Kingdom). I am currently investigating the mechanisms of transmission of tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease or Frontotemporal dementia using the fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*, as a model organism. Since my PhD, my research experience has been centred in the use of the powerful genetic toolkits available on this model animal, with a focus on cell and developmental biology, genetics and image analysis. It is thanks to the latter category that I started learning code programming using MATLAB, and the recent technological developments have further pushed me to start learning other languages (Python) and to grasp the broad discipline of data science, including machine learning.

This website is stored at GitHub and mostly written in Markdown language. The original template, academicpages, can be found  [here](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) to be forked and used to build your very own website in a quick manner. Academicpages is itself a fork of the  [Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/).

How to navigate on this site
======
 - The previous paragraph summarizes my career in a few lines. A more comprehensive resume is my CV (academic and non-academic formats), which can be accessed [here](https://miguelramirezmoreno.github.io/cv/). The CV includes the basic information found in the rest of the pages, but obviously does not go as deep.
 - Get a primer of the research projects I have worked on in the [research](https://miguelramirezmoreno.github.io/research/) page.
 - Consult my list of publications [here](https://miguelramirezmoreno.github.io/publications/).
 - The [teaching](https://miguelramirezmoreno.github.io/teaching/) page details my experience with students during my trajectory at UK universities.
 - The [portfolio](https://miguelramirezmoreno.github.io/portfolio/) details my experience with image analysis (developed tools) and my ongoing formation with data science.
 - Finally, I will be reporting ongoing projects (from the learning of a new image analysis script to tips to make your own website) in two places: the blog (accessed in this very same website) and my Substack feed.
